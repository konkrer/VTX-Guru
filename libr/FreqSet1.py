"""
A class made to hold a frequency group of 5GHz FPV VTX channels,
then analyze and/or score for IMD interference level.

Investigate method allows for scoring all possible combinations of
channels in study group. 40 channels, plus lowband channels availavle
to add to study group. Only groups with passing scores are output to
file.  U.S. legal channels only option available. Selective removal
of channels allows for almost all possible subsets of parent set to
be explored. (removal allowed up to 40 channels)
